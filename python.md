# Introduction to Python

###### \(Excerpt from Wikipedia\)

## What is Python?

**Python **is an [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)[high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) for [general-purpose programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language). Created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes [code readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_readability), and a [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_%28programming_languages%29) that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer [lines of code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code),[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-Summerfield-25)[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-26)notably using [significant whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_whitespace). It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-7-27)

Python features a [dynamic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_type) system and automatic [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management). It supports multiple [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm), including [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming),[imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming),[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), and has a large and comprehensive [standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library).[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-About-28)

Python interpreters are available for many [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), the [reference implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation) of Python, is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-29)and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation).

## History of Python

Python was conceived in the late 1980s[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-venners-interview-pt-1-30),and its implementation began in December 1989[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-timeline-of-python-31)by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrum_Wiskunde_%26_Informatica)\(CWI\) in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) as a successor to the [ABC language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_%28programming_language%29)\(itself inspired by [SETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETL)\)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-12-32)capable of [exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) and interfacing with the [Amoeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_%28operating_system%29) operating system.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-faq-created-6)Van Rossum remains Python's principal author. His continuing central role in Python's development is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community:[Benevolent Dictator For Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_For_Life)\(BDFL\).

On the origins of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-33)

> ...In December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_%28programming_language%29) that would appeal to [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)/[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)[hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29). I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood \(and a big fan of \[Monty Python's Flying Circus\]\(\[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty\_Python's\_Flying\_Circus\)\]\(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty\_Python's\_Flying\_Circus\)\)\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python's_Flying_Circus%29]%28https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python's_Flying_Circus%29%29\)\).

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 and had many major new features, including a [cycle-detecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection)[garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29) and support for [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). With this release, the development process became more transparent and community-backed.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-newin-2.0-34)

Python 3.0 \(initially called Python 3000 or py3k\) was released on 3 December 2008 after a long testing period. It is a major revision of the language that is not [backward-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility) with previous versions.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-3.0-release-35)However, many of its major features have been [backported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting) to the backward-compatible Python 2.6.x[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-pep-3000-36)and 2.7.x version series.

Python 2.7's[end-of-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_%28product%29) date \(a.k.a. EOL, sunset date\) was initially set at 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-37)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-38)In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29)[transcompiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcompiler). [The Register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Register) speculated that this was in response to Python 2.7's planned end-of-life[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-39), but Google cited performance under concurrent workloads as their only motivation.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-40)

## Philosophy and Features

Python is a [multi-paradigm programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-paradigm_programming_language).[Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) are fully supported, and many of its features support [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [aspect-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming)\(including by [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-13-41)and [metaobjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaobject)\(magic methods\)\).[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-14-42)Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including [design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-15-43)[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-16-44) and [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming).[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-17-45)

Python uses [dynamic typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_typing), and a combination of [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting) and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management). It also features dynamic [name resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_resolution_%28programming_languages%29)\([late binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding)\), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Python's design offers some support for [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) in the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) tradition. It has `filter()`,`map()`, and`reduce()`functions; [list comprehensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension),[dictionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), and sets; and [generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28computer_programming%29) expressions.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-59-46)The standard library has two modules \(itertools and functools\) that implement functional tools borrowed from [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29) and [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML).[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-18-47)

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The [Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python)\(PEP 20\), which includes [aphorisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism) such as:[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-PEP20-48)

* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
* Readability counts

Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_%28programming_language%29), which espoused the opposite approach.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-venners-interview-pt-1-30)

While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax \(such as that of[Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl)\) in favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar. As [Alex Martelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli) put it: "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-19-49)Python's philosophy rejects the Perl "[there is more than one way to do it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_more_than_one_way_to_do_it)" approach to language design in favor of "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it".[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-PEP20-48)

Python's developers strive to avoid [premature optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_optimization), and reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-20-50)When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use [PyPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy), a [just-in-time compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation).[Cython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython) is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.

An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python)[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-24-51)—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs \(from a [famous Monty Python sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28Monty_Python%29)\) instead of the standard [foo and bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar).[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-52)[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-53)

A common [neologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism) in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.

Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonists, Pythonistas, and Pythoneers.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-27-54)[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-25-55)

## Syntax and semantics

Main article:

[Python syntax and semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics)

Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_bracket_programming_language) to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) or [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29).[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-52-56)

### Indentation

Main article:[Python syntax and semantics § Indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Indentation)

Python uses [whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) indentation, rather than [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_bracket_programming_language) or keywords, to delimit [blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_%28programming%29). An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-53-57)This feature is also sometimes termed the [off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule).

### Statements and control flow

Python's [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_%28computer_science%29) include \(among others\):

* The assignment statement \(token '=', the equals sign\). This operates differently than in traditional [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) languages, and this fundamental mechanism \(including the nature of Python's version of variables\) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29), e.g.,`x = 2`, translates to "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The \(right-hand\) value is copied into an [allocated storage location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#ALLOCATION) for which the \(left-hand\) [variable name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29) is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough \(potentially quite large\) for the declared [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system). In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example,`x = 2`, translates to "\(generic\) name x receives a [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28computer_programming%29) to a separate, dynamically allocated [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28computer_science%29) of numeric \(int\) type of value 2." This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g.,`x = 2`;`y = 2`;`z = 2`result in allocating storage to \(at most\) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which **will **have a type; thus there is [dynamic typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_type).
* The [`if`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-then-else) statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with `else`and `elif`\(a contraction of else-if\).
* The [`for`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach#Python) statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
* The [`while`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop#Python) statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.
* The [`try`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_syntax#Python) statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by `except`clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a `finally`block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.
* The `class`statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a  [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_science%29), for use in [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).
* The `def`statement, which defines a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28computing%29) or [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_%28computing%29).
* The `with`statement \(from Python 2.5\), which encloses a code block within a context manager \(for example, acquiring a [lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_%28computer_science%29) before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) and then closing it\), allowing [Resource Acquisition Is Initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization)\(RAII\)-like behavior.
* The `pass`statement, which serves as a [NOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP). It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.
* The [`assert`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_%28programming%29) statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.
* The `yield`statement, which returns a value from a [generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28computer_science%29#Python) function. From Python 2.5 `yield`is also an operator. This form is used to implement [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine).
* The `import`statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program There are two ways of using import:`from<module name>import *`or `import<module name>`.
* The `print`statement was changed to the `print()`function in Python 3.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-diff_py2-3-58)

Python does not support [tail call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) optimization or [first-class continuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_continuations), and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-55-59)[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-56-60)However, better support for [coroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine)-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's [generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28computer_science%29).[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-57-61)Before 2.5, generators were [lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation)[iterators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator); information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-58-62)

### Expressions

Some Python [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_%28computer_science%29) are similar to languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29), while some are not:

* Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division and integer division.[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-63)Python also added the `**`operator for exponentiation.

* From Python 3.5, it enables support of [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) with the`@`operator.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-PEP465-64)[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-Python3.5Changelog-65)

* In Python, `==`compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-66)and objects by reference.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-67)\(Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the `equals()`method.\) Python's `is`operator may be used to compare object identities \(comparison by reference\). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example `a<= b<= c`.
* Python uses the words `and`,`or`,`not`for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic`&&`,`||`,`!`used in Java and C.
* Python has a type of expression termed a [list comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension#Python). Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a [generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_%28computer_science%29) expression.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-59-46)
* [Anonymous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function) are implemented using [lambda expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_%28programming%29); however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.
* Conditional expressions in Python are written as `x if c else`[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-60-68)\(different in order of operands from the [`c ? x : y`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:) operator common to many other languages\).
* Python makes a distinction between [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_%28computer_science%29) and [tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple). Lists are written as`[1, 2, 3]`, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries \(dictionary keys must be [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable) in Python\). Tuples are written as`(1, 2, 3)`, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable `t`initially equal to`(1, 2, 3)`, executing `t = t + (4, 5)`first evaluates `t + (4, 5)`, which yields`(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, which is then assigned back to`t`, thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of`t`, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-69)
* Python features
  sequence unpacking
  where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to \(a variable, a writable property, etc\), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an
  iterable
  object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.\[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\]
* Python has a "string format" operator`%`. This functions analogous to [`printf`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf) format strings in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29), e.g.`"spam=%s eggs=%d" ("blah", 2)`evaluates to`"spam=blah eggs=2"`. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the `format()`method of the
  `str`class, e.g.`"spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2)`, Python 3.6 added "f-strings":`f'spam={"blah"} eggs={2}'`.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-pep-0498-70)

Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or [lambda expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_%28programming%29), all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as `a = 1`cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator`=`for an equality operator`==`in conditions:`if (c = 1) { ... }`is syntactically valid \(but probably unintended\) C code but`if c = 1: ...`causes a syntax error in Python.

### Methods

[Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_%28programming%29) on objects are [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28programming%29) attached to the object's class; the syntax `instance.method(argument)`is, for normal methods and functions,[syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) for `Class.method(instance, argument)`. Python methods have an explicit [`self`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_%28computer_programming%29) parameter to access [instance data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_data), in contrast to the implicit `self`\(or `this`\) in some other object-oriented programming languages \(e.g.,[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29),[Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C), or [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29)\).[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-61-71)

### Typing

Python uses [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at [compile time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time); rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information), Python is [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_typed_programming_language), forbidding operations that are not well-defined \(for example, adding a number to a string\) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.

Python allows programmers to define their own types using [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_science%29), which are most often used for [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). New [instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28computer_science%29) of classes are constructed by calling the class \(for example,`SpamClass()`or`EggsClass()`\), and the classes are instances of the [metaclass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaclass)`type`\(itself an instance of itself\), allowing [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) and [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29).

Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes:old-style and new-style.[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-classy-72)The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class`object`is inherited from, directly or indirectly \(all new-style classes inherit from`object`and are instances of`type`\). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 on wards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.

The long term plan is to support [gradual typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing)[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-73)and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named mypysupports compile-time type checking.[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-74)

### Mathematics

Python has the usual C arithmetic operators \(`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`,`%`\). It also has`**`for exponentiation, e.g.`5**3 == 125`and`9**0.5 == 3.0`, and a new matrix multiply`@`operator is included in version 3.5.[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-76)Additionally, it has a unary operator \(`~`\), which essentially inverts all the bytes of its one argument. For integers, this means`~x=-x-1`.[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-77)Other operators include bitwise shift operators`x << y`, which shifts`x`to the left`y`places, the same as`x*(2**y)`, and`x >> y`, which shifts`x`to the right`y`places, the same as`x/(2**y)`.[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-78)

The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-pep0238-79)

* Python 2.1 and earlier use the C division behavior. The`/`operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g.`7/3 == 2`and `-7/3 == -2`.
* Python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g.`7/3 == 2`and `-7/3 == -3`. The floor division`//`
  operator is introduced. So `7//3 == 2`,`-7//3 == -3`,`7.5//3 == 2.0`and `-7.5//3 == -3.0`. Adding `from __future__ import division`causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division \(see next\).
* Python 3.0 changes`/`to be always floating-point division. In Python terms, the pre-3.0 `/`isclassic division, the version-3.0 `/`is real division, and`//`is floor division.

Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation`(a + b)//b == a//b + 1`is always true. It also means that the equation`b*(a//b) + a%b == a`is valid for both positive and negative values of`a`. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of`a%b`is, as expected, in the [half-open interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-open_interval)\[0,b\), where`b`is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval \(b, 0\] when`b`is negative.[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-62-80)

Python provides a`round`function for [rounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding)a float to the nearest integer. For [tie-breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Tie-breaking), versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero:`round(0.5)`is 1.0,`round(-0.5)`is −1.0.[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-63-81)Python 3 uses [round to even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_to_even):`round(1.5)`is 2,`round(2.5)`is 2.[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-64-82)

Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression`a < b < c`tests whether`a`is less than`b`and`b`is less than`c`. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate`a < b`, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with`c`.[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-65-83)\[[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)\]

Python has extensive built-in support for[arbitrary precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_precision_arithmetic). Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision \(usually 32 or 64 bits\), belonging to the python type`int`, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the python type`long`, where needed. The latter have an "L" suffix in their textual representation.[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-84)\(In Python 3, the distinction between the`int`and`long`types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the`int`class.\) The`Decimal`type/class in module`decimal`\(since version 2.4\) provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-85)The`Fraction`type in module`fractions`\(since version 2.6\) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-86)

Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library[NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.

## Libraries

Python's large [standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library), commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-86-87)provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) and [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) are supported. It includes modules for creating [graphical user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), connecting to [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database),[generating pseudorandom numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator), arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals,[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-88-88)manipulating [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), and [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).

Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications \(for example, the[Web Server Gateway Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface)\(WSGI\) implementation`wsgiref`follows PEP 333[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-AutoNT-89-89)\), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites \(if supplied\). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.

As of September 2017,the [Python Package Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 117,000[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-90)packages with a wide range of functionality, including:

* Graphical user interfaces
* Web frameworks
* Multimedia
* Databases
* Networking
* Test frameworks
* Automation
* Web scraping
* Documentation
* System administration
* Scientific computing
* Text processing
* Image processing

## Development environments

See also: [Comparison of integrated development environments § Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python)

Most Python implementations \(including CPython\) include a [read–eval–print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop)\(REPL\), permitting them to function as a [command line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interpreter) for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.

Other shells, including [IDLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE_%28Python%29) and [IPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython), add further abilities such as auto-completion, session state retention and [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).

As well as standard desktop [integrated development environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)\(see Wikipedia's "[Python IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_IDE)" article\), there are [Web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)-based IDEs; [SageMath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SageMath)\(intended for developing science and math-related Python programs\);[PythonAnywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PythonAnywhere), a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#cite_note-91)
