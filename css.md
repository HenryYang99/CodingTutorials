# Introduction to CSS

## What is CSS?

**Cascading Style Sheets**\(**CSS**\) is a [style sheet language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_language) used for describing the [presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_semantics) of a document written in a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-1)Although most often used to set the visual style of [web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) and user interfaces written in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [XHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML), the language can be applied to any [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) document, including [plain XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_XML),[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) and [XUL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL), and is applicable to rendering in [speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis), or on other media. Along with HTML and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_applications), and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-2)

CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the [layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_layout),[colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color), and [fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-3)This separation can improve content [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility), provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

Separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice \(via speech-based browser or [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader)\), and on [Braille-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_display) tactile devices. It can also display the web page differently depending on the screen size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified.

Changes to the [graphic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design) of a document \(or hundreds of documents\) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in the CSS file they use, rather than by changing markup in the documents.

The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities \(or weights\) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium)\(W3C\). Internet media type \([MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_media_type)\)`text/css`is registered for use with CSS by [RFC 2318](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2318)\(March 1998\). The W3C operates a free [CSS validation service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Markup_Validation_Service#CSS_validation) for CSS documents.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-4)

## History

CSS was first proposed by [Håkon Wium Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Håkon_Wium_Lie) on October 10, 1994.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-chss-proposal-17)At the time, Lie was working with [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-chapter20-18)Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation \(CSS1\)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-w3c-css1-19)being released in 1996. In particular,[Bert Bos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos)' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-WWW3-20)

Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language \([SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML)\) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-css-phd-21)One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like [DSSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Style_Semantics_and_Specification_Language) and [FOSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatting_Output_Specification_Instance) were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-css-phd-21)

As [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of [web developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development). This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) implementations, such as [ViolaWWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW) and [WorldWideWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb),[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-IEEE-22)made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-cssdftw-23)[Robert Cailliau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau), also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-IEEE-22)

Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-css-phd-21)Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-chss-proposal-17)and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal \(SSP\).[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-WWW3-20)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-ssp-24)Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with [Yves Lafon](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yves_Lafon&action=edit&redlink=1) to implement CSS in [Dave Raggett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Raggett)'s [Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_%28web_browser%29) browser.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-25)[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-27)[Bert Bos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos) implemented his own SSP proposal in the [Argo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_%28web_browser%29) browser.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-WWW3-20)Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard \(the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML\).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-chapter20-18)

Lie's proposal was presented at the "[Mosaic and the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mosaic_and_the_Web&action=edit&redlink=1)" conference \(later called WWW2\) in [Chicago, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois) in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-chapter20-18)Around this time the W3C was already being established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by [Steven Pemberton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pemberton). This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board \(ERB\). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including[Thomas Reardon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Reardon)of[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), participating as well. In August 1996 [Netscape Communication Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) presented an alternative style sheet language called [JavaScript Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Style_Sheets)\(JSSS\).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-chapter20-18)The spec was never finished and is deprecated.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-28)By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.

Development of HTML, CSS, and the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review Board \(ERB\). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three [working groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_group):[HTML Working group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Working_group), chaired by [Dan Connolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Connolly_%28computer_scientist%29) of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of[SoftQuad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftQuad); and [CSS Working group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_group), chaired by [Chris Lilley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lilley_%28W3C%29) of W3C.

The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.

In 2005 the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.

### Difficulty with adoption

The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's [Internet Explorer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_3)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-chapter20-18)was released in that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. [IE 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_4) and [Netscape 4.x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification.[Internet Explorer 5.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac) for the [Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh), shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full \(better than 99 percent\) CSS 1 support,[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-29)surpassing [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_%28web_browser%29), which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support 15 months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterwards, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2.

However, even when later ‘version 5’ web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs and other [quirks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode).[Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_5), as opposed to the very different [IE for Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac), had seriously a incorrect implementation of the ‘[CSS box model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_box_model)’, as compared with the CSS standards. This is a set of rules that specify certain aspects of the sizing and layout of components of a web page. Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across browsers and [platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform) without the use of [workarounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaround) termed [CSS hacks and filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_hack). The IE/Windows box model bugs were so serious that, when [Internet Explorer 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6) was released, Microsoft introduced a backwards-compatible mode of CSS interpretation \(‘[quirks mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode)’\) plus an alternative, corrected 'standards mode'. Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided this very same ‘mode’-switch behavior capability. Unfortunately, ever since the release of IE 6 in 2001, it has become necessary for the authors of webpages’ [html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html) files to make sure that the html contains a special distinctive[‘standards-compliant CSS intended’ marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration#HTML5_DTD-less_DOCTYPE) to show that the authors intend CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete [IE5/Windows browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_5). Without this marker, web browsers that have the ‘quirks mode’-switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE5/Windows would rather than following CSS standards.

Problems with browsers' patchy adoption of CSS, along with errata in the original specification, led the W3C to revise the CSS 2 standard into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. CSS 2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS 2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-30)and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-31)

In addition to these problems, the`.css`extension was used by a software product used to convert[PowerPoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint)files into Compact Slide Show files,[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-32)so some web servers served all`.css`[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-33)as[mime type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type)`application/x-pointplus`[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-34)rather than`text/css`.

### Variations

CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.

#### CSS 1

The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on December 17, 1996. [Håkon Wium Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Håkon_Wium_Lie) and [Bert Bos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos) are credited as the original developers.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-35)[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-36)Among its capabilities are support for

* [Font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface) properties such as typeface and emphasis
* Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements
* Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text
* [Alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_%28typesetting%29) of text, images,[tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_%28HTML%29) and other elements
* Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
* Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes

The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-37)

#### CSS 2

CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and [z-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-index), the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets \(which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules\)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-38)and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.

The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-39)

#### CSS 2.1

CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a [Candidate Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/)on February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on June 13, 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However, because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010.

CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-40)After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee, it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-w3.org-41)

CSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low priority work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015.

#### CSS 3

Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-World_Wide_Web_Consortium-42)

Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-43)As of June 2012, there are over fifty CSS modules published from the CSS Working Group.,[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-World_Wide_Web_Consortium-42)and four of these have been published as formal [recommendations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_recommendation):

* 2012-06-19: [Media Queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_queries)
* 2011-09-29: [Namespaces](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs#namespace)
* 2011-09-29: [Selectors Level 3](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs#selectors)
* 2011-06-07: [Color](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs#color)

Some modules have [Candidate Recommendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Recommendation#Candidate_Recommendation_%28CR%29)\(CR\) status and are considered moderately stable. At CRstage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-44)

| css3-ui | [CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3 \(CSS3 UI\)](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-ui-3/) | WorkingDraft | Jul 2015 |

#### CSS 4

There is no single, integrated CSS4 specification,[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-46)because it is split into separate "level 4" modules.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-47)

Because CSS3 split the CSS language's definition into modules, the modules have been allowed to level independently. Most modules are level 3—they build on things from CSS 2.1. A few level-4 modules exist \(such as Image Values,[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-48)[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-49)Backgrounds & Borders,[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-50)or Selectors\),[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-51)which build on the functionality of a preceding level-3 module. Other modules defining entirely new functionality, such as [Flexbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexbox), have been designated as "level 1".[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-52)

The CSS Working Group sometimes publishes "Snapshots", a collection of whole modules and parts of other drafts that are considered stable, interoperably implemented and hence ready to use. So far, four such best current practices document have been published as Notes, in 2007,[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-53)2010,[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-54)2015.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-55)and 2017.[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#cite_note-56)
